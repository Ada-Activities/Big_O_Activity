# Big_O_Activity
This activity is an opportunity to assess the space and time complexity of pre-written code.

## Step 0: Fork and Clone this Repo
- We are not including a requirements.txt so there is no need to activate a venv, but you may if you so choose.

## Step 1: Play around with the Code
- Identify where the code starts running.
- Identify the code that has been commented out.
- Make sure you can run each scenario by adjusting the commented code.
- Make sure that for each scenario, you are able to run each sample input by adjusting the commented code.

## Step 2: Assess Sidewinder
- This is the sidewinder problem from the While Loops Problem Set. Please answer the following three questions in your group:
  - What does this function do?
  - What is the 0() of the time complexity? Why?
  - What is the 0() of the space complexity? Why?

## Step 3: Assess Sum Digits
- Answer the following questions about `sum_digits` in your group:
  - What does this function do?
   - What is the 0() of the time complexity? Why?
  - What is the 0() of the space complexity? Why?
  - Try adding similar counting code to that shown in sidewinder


## Step 4: Assess Most Common Entry
- Answer the following questions about `most_common_entry` in your group:
  - What does this function do?
   - What is the 0() of the time complexity? Why?
  - What is the 0() of the space complexity? Why?

## Step 5: Refactoring Most Common Entry (Live Code)

When you have finished discussion all three functions, we will return to the main room to discuss an alternate solution to `most_common_entry`. Once completed, we will discuss the space and time complexity as a class.
